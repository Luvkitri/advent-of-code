# Advent of Code

## 2023

Used that year's AoC to learn new language Rust. Failed to solve all problems but either way learned a lot. 

Parts I failed to figure out by myself - Finished after additional research:
- Day 8 part 2 - Lowest common divisor / Greatest common divisor
- Day 21 part 2 - Quadratic Sequences
- Day 25 part 1 - Minimum cut problem (Didn't push solution as I used existing crate to solve it)

Parts I completely failed
- Day 12 part 1 & 2
- Day 22 part 1 & 2
- Day 24 part 2
